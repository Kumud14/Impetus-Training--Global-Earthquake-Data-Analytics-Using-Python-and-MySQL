# Impetus-Training--Global-Earthquake-Data-Analytics-Using-Python-and-MySQL
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes global earthquake data from 1965 to 2016 using Python and MySQL.
The aim is to extract insights from numerical earthquake data such as magnitude, depth, and location coordinates, and present descriptive statistics and group-based analysis.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Perform descriptive statistical analysis (Mean, Max, Min) on earthquake magnitude and depth.

Group earthquakes by year and depth range.

Identify the Top 5 deepest and most powerful earthquakes.

Optionally analyze fatalities if the dataset contains Deaths column.
